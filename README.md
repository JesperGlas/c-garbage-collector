# c-garbage-collector
A learning project for garbage collection in C.

## Description
Credit to Matthew Plant who's the author of the [guide](https://maplant.com/gc.html) I've been following for this project. The main goal of this project is to implement his code, with my convention preferences, and try to understand and comment each step of the way. As a part of this I also want to include a verbose mode of execution which prints info about the underlying processes to the terminal.

## Build and Run
The project is built with a Makefile in the source directory.
